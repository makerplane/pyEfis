pyEfis
==================

This is an Electronic Flight Information System written in Python.

It was created for use in the MakerPlane Open Source Aircraft Project.

pyEfis is written primarily in Python and PyQt.

It does not have any method of reading flight information directly from the
hardware but instead uses FIX Gateway as it's source of information.  FIX
Gateway is a plugin based program that allows different types of flight
information systems to communicate to one another.  pyEfis contains a client
to FIX Gateway and so has access to all the flight data that FIX Gateway
is configured for.

This program is quite immature at this stage and should not be used
in an aircraft of any kind.

See the user.hooks module for ways to define other keys.

Virtual VFR
-----------------------------
In order to take advantage of virtual VFR chart object rendering, download the latest
FAA CIFP file from here: https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/cifp/download/

Extract the FAACIFP18 file into the pyEfis/CIFP directory. Make note of the FAA disclaimers also in the zip file.

Create an index file:
'''
./MakeCIFPIndex.py CIFP/FAACIFP18
'''

This creates an index.bin file in CIFP directory


Update the config file [Screen.PFD] section dbpath and indexpath
with the path names of the FAACIFP18 and index.bin files respectively.
