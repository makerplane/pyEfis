# This section defines FIX IDs that we'll write out to the
# FIX Gateway server.  Each can be defined as one of three
# methods.  Interval will look at the time out lifetime (TOL)
# of the point and send the data at half that interval.
# OnChange will send when the value is changed and Both will
# do both.
outputs:
  BARO: Interval
  BTN16: OnChange


# Screen definitions describe the screens that will be loaded
# and ready for use.  Each section should start with "Screen."
# followed by the name.  The only required configuration is
# module, which is the module that will be loaded to render
# the screen

  PFD:
    module: screens.pfd_sm

  SixPack:
    module: screens.sixpack

  # Test:
  #   module: screens.test
  #   title: Test Screen

# Hooks are user defined modules that are loaded at specific points
# in the programs execution.  Right now their is only one place and
# it is right after all of the initialization and just before the
